## Recommendation for Your Project

### ✅ **Start with Hobby (Free) Plan**

**Why:**

- 100 GB bandwidth/month is plenty for most websites
- 100 builds/month is sufficient for regular updates

- All essential features included

**When to upgrade to Pro:**

**When to consider Enterprise:**

- Require advanced security features
- Need custom resource allocations

## Cost Estimate for Your Site

**Hobby Plan (Free):**
- Static React site: $0/month
- Perfect for personal/small business sites
- No serverless functions = no function costs

**Pro Plan (if needed):**
- Base: $20/month
- Likely no overages for a typical website
- **Total: ~$20/month**

## Summary

| Plan | Best For | Monthly Cost |
|------|----------|--------------|
| **Hobby** | Personal projects, small sites | **$0** |
| **Pro** | Professional sites, teams | **$20+** |
| **Enterprise** | Large organizations | **Custom** |

**My Recommendation:** Start with the **Hobby (Free)** plan. It's perfect for your React app and you can always upgrade later if needed.
